# Potentiometer Protyping Box

This github project contains the 3D STL files and parts list for my Potentiometer Prototying Box project  

The parts list and wiring are pretty simple:

[5 slide potentiometers](https://amzn.to/2R1zZVO)

These pots have 2 sets of pins for weening and/or waxing readings... for this project, I only used one set. I assume the need for dual-direction readings would be useful in audio applications?

So they are wired using one set of pins per pot:  
   1. Each ground pin from the 5 pots are wired together and then wired to the input connector
   2. Each VIN pin from the 5 pots are wired together and then wired to the input connector
   3. Each Data pin from the 5 pots is wired to the input connector
