# Nova SM3 - a Spot-Mini Micro clone
![Nova-SM3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cguweb-com/Arduino-Projects/main/Nova-SM3/novasm3.png)  
This github project contains the 3D STL files, parts list, electrical diagrams, and the software for my spot-mini clone project, Nova Spot Micro  

These files were not created with public consumption in mind, and are constantly under development, so use at your own risk!  

A list of links (yes, Amazon affiliate links!) to all of the hardware components used can be found below for this project.  

I'd be happy to answer any questions, and/or receive any type of feedback... happy hacking!

### RELEASE NOTES  

      - Arduino mega performance: 36% storage / 31% memory
      - splt AsyncServo class into an include file
      - created serial connection to arduino nano / slave
      - created functions for serial communication to nano / slave
      - moved uss, rgb, and oled functions to nano / slave companion file: Nova-SM3_nano-vX.x
      - Bug Fix: state machine intervals were not being set / reset for USS and MPU sensors
      - added stop on uss alarm and halt on pir alarm

##    
### DEV NOTES  

      - [ ] BUG: ramping: on interruption of ramp, servo speed is set to the speed of the point of interrupt
      - [ ] re-calibrate servo home positions to balance Nova's COG!! seems to be back-heavy
      - [ ] x_axis: tweak pattern, adjusting use of move_steps to not near fall over backwards on startup
      - [ ] finish tweaking left and right stepping
      - [ ] finish forward step (w/ left, right, backwards!)
      - [ ] write a z-axis control that is sticky, so it maintains the set height on subsequent moves
      - [ ] write a stable fixed speed / step walking routine
      - [ ] fix 'stay' routine (ie: tends to fall backward when coming off of kneel or sit positions into stay)
      - [ ] work on integrating MPU data into movements

      see **DEV NOTES** in code comments for more bugs/tasks
